Write a program that will iterate from 0 to 10 and display squares of numbers.


   for (var x = 0; x <= 10; x++) {
       console.log(x * x);   
   }
	

1. Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.


1. Write a program to sum the multiples of 3 and 5 under 1000.


1. Write a program to compute the sum and product of an array of integers.


1. Write a program which prints the elements of the following array as a single string.


var x = ['1', 'A', 'B', "c", "r", true, NaN, undefined];


1. Write a program that prints the elements of the following array.


var a = [
[1, 2, 1, 24], 
[8, 11, 9, 4], 
[7, 0, 7, 27]
];


1. Write a program that outputs the sum of squares of the first 20 numbers. 


1. Write a program that computes average marks of the following students. Then use this average to determine the corresponding grade. 
        
David
	80
	Marko
	77
	Dany
	88
	John
	95
	Thomas
	68
	

The grades are computed as follows :


< 60%
	F
	< 70%
	D
	< 80%
	C
	< 90%
	B
	< 100%
	A
	



1. Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).


Note: This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you’ve solved it, you’re now allowed to feel good about yourself.
